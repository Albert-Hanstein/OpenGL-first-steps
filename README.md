# OpenGL-first-steps
My first work on OpenGL using C++.

I started with a wireframe sphere:

I moved on to a lighted sphere:

And for fun, I made a wireframe rocket:

Use 'premake4 gmake' and 'make' in command prompt in the same directory as the code files. Make sure the necessary libraries have been installed as per lab zero.
